# PCB's Soldering and Repair Work

## Rectification Circuit

A rectification circuit for some GPIO's on a Embedded Device which were switching rapidly due to interference. I designed, sourced boards, managed BoMs and soldered 2500 of these boards alone. Every device needed to be tested and i had to allow for many different footprint sizes as during covid electronics parts were hard to come by

## One Handed Gameboy

A Prototype I made to allow the gameboy colour to be played with one hand. In case of disability or preference. The system uses a comparator circuit to convert the joystick to button inputs of the gameboy

## Macrokeypad

I did QA and development in tandem with a developer who made what i think is the best macrokeypad.

## PCB art

I have played around with making circuitboard art by using the cutout and shapes generating in Altium as parts of the artwork, Here is a lightning detector circuit on a Lightning pokemon
