# Home Server

What began as a simple desire to store my personal files outside of the Google Cloud quickly snowballed into a full-blown passion for Linux, system administration, and networking.

In 2015, I earned my CCNA, which gave me a deeper understanding of the complexity of networking. In my free time, I experimented with VLANs and network shares using a cheap router. Over time, I progressively built more complex setupsâ€”from using an old laptop with a portable hard drive to writing my own firewall for the router, designing my network, and installing open-source software on a NAS. Eventually, I dove into the world of Virtual Machines, Docker, and Ansible, which all culminated in the creation of my homelab.

## Infrastructure

- **MikroTik RB2011 Router**: Reliable, feature-packed router for managing the network
- **Netgear POE Switch**: Power over Ethernet support for easy device connectivity
- **TerraMaster F4-F423 NAS**: 22TB of usable storage with a parity drive for redundancy
- **Mini PC**: Used to run virtual machines and containerized services

## Software I Use

- **Proxmox**: Open-source virtualization platform with a completely web-based GUI for managing virtual machines
- **OpenMediaVault**: Installed on the NAS, replacing TerraMaster's stock software (which wasn't up to par)
- **Docker**: All my services are hosted in Docker containers for easy deployment and management
- **Ansible**: Used to automate the creation of virtual machines that host Docker containers

## Containers and Services

- **Bookstack**: An open-source knowledge base platform for our local network (think of it like a Wikipedia)
- **Immich**: Self-hosted alternative to Google Photos
- **Nextcloud**: Self-hosted Google Drive replacement with built-in office suite
- **Grist**: Self-hosted database/spreadsheet tool for collaborative data management
- **Jellyfin**: Self-hosted media server (a great alternative to Netflix)
