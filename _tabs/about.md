# About Me

Hey, I’m Ross Fiamingo, and I have been working as a technical specialist for the past 15 years. 

What exactly does that mean?

HArdware and software rarely meet in the middle and just work, configurations, drivers missing dependencies, config mismatch. This is where I shine. I have been deploying, configuring and commissioning hardware in difficult environments for a good long while now.


This website is a place to share some of the projects I’ve worked on — both in the workplace and on personal projects. 

Feel free to explore the site and check out what I’ve been working on. If you’d like to connect or chat about any of the projects, don’t hesitate to reach out!
