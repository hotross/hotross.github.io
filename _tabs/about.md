# About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm Ross! I‚Äôve been working as a Technical Support Specialist for the past 15 years.

Technical roles can be tricky to explain without diving into the nitty-gritty details, but I like to think of myself as a bridge‚Äîconnecting complex technology with simple, actionable solutions.

Electronics can be complicated. Software can be complicated. And when you combine them, it can feel like a nightmare. The real challenge comes when you're isolating the root cause of an issue‚Äîwhether it's a hardware fault, a software bug, or a configuration problem. Solving these types of complex issues is what excites me most.

I have a deep passion for both hardware and software, and this website is where I‚Äôll be showcasing some of the projects I‚Äôm most proud of.
